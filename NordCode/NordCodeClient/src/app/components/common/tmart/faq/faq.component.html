        <div><br>A. Well, that is up to you but you can also be a couch potato like our founders and have your items delivered to your house for free. Our prices are sometimes lower than that of major superstores in the city. We also carry a larger variety

            let us know.&nbsp;<br><br></div>
        <div><strong><br>Q. How do you deliver?</strong>&nbsp;<br><br></div>

        <div><strong><br>Q. What is your discounting policy?</strong>&nbsp;<br><br></div>
        <div><br>A. We try to provide the best deals in Dhaka and many of our products are already discounted below the maximum retail price (MRP). We also offer discount codes under special circumstances, which are applied on the MRP. On any given product,
            we can only apply one type of discount. We always consider the best discount available to the customer. For example: If the MRP of a product is Tk. 100 and our list price is Tk. 92 -- the product is already sold at a 8% discount. This means
            that if user applies a discount code for 5% discount, we will still consider the best discount available to the user and sell the product at Tk. 92.&nbsp;<br><br></div>
        <div><strong><br>Q.&nbsp; Can I order over the phone?</strong>&nbsp;<br><br></div>

        <div><strong><br>Q. What about quality?</strong>&nbsp;<br><br></div>
        <div><br>A. We try our best to source the best quality items for you but if you are dissatisfied, you can always send them back with the delivery person. If you forget to do that, you can call us within 3 days and we will replace the item for free.&nbsp;<br><br></div>
        <div><strong><br>Q. How are you sourcing your products?</strong>&nbsp;<br><br></div>
        <div><br>A. We have deals with whole-sellers, manufacturers and importers. We only sell authentic products.&nbsp;<br><br></div>
        <div><strong><br>Q. Should I tip the delivery representative?</strong>&nbsp;<br><br></div>
        <div><br>A. Tips are not required. But our delivery team members appreciate recognition for their hard work. Delivery representatives keep the entire tip amount.<br><br></div>
